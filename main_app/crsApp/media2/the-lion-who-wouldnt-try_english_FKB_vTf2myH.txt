It was a sunny day in the jungle.
All the animals were out playing.

“Come play with me, Lion,” said Cheetah.
“Catch me if you can!”
zoom-zoom! went Cheetah.
“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”

“Come play with me, Lion,” said Elephant.
“We can throw rocks!”
ka-pow! ka-pow! went Elephant.
“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”

“Come play with us, Lion!” said the monkeys.
“Who can eat the most bananas?”
pop! pop! pop! went the monkeys.
“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”

“Come play with me, Lion," said Springbok.
“Let’s jump high!”
zoop! zoop! zoop! went Springbok.
“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”

“Come play with me, Lion,” said Crocodile.
“It’s a swimming competition!”
splash! splash! went Crocodile.
“I don’t want to play,” said Lion. “I’ll lose.”

Crocodile was quicker than Elephant,
but each time Crocodile got ahead,
Elephant tickled him!
tee-hee-hee! went Elephant and
Crocodile.

Elephant and Crocodile had the swimming
competition without Lion.

Lion sat sadly by himself, watching Crocodile and
Elephant swim.

“Why are you sad, Lion?” asked Mouse.
“Because I don't want to play,” said Lion.
“I'll lose."

Lion slipped on a banana peel!
wheeeeee! went Lion.
“That looks like fun!” said all the other animals.

Lion played,
and he was happy.
